# Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a book search engine where you can search books and instantly access thousands of titles. There are some features missing in this application, but I tried my best to make it work. Full transparency I was running out of time to get these modules in and I had to turn something in. gave it my best given the time constraints. The search and functionality with the books api does work, but I was not able to finish many features.
